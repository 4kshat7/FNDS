        <h2>FAKE NEWS DETECTION SYSTEM!</h2>
        <br>
      <p>
        The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter)<br> paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before.<br> With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before,<br> some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality.<br> Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task.<br> Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict<br> on the truthfulness of an article. In this work,<br> we propose to use machine learning ensemble approach for automated classification of news articles.<br> Our study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish<br> fake contents from real. By using those properties,<br> we train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods and evaluate their performance on 4 real world datasets.<br> Experimental evaluation confirms the superior performance of our proposed ensemble learner<br> approach in comparison to individual learners.

        In the current fake news corpus,<br> there have been multiple instances where both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are used to classify text.<br> However, most of the literature focuses on specific datasets or domains,<br> most prominently the politics domain. Therefore, the algorithm trained works best on a particular type of articleâ€™s<br> domain and does not achieve optimal results when exposed to articles from other domains.<br> Since articles from different domains have a unique textual structure,<br> it is difficult to train a generic algorithm that works best on all particular news domains.<br> In this paper, we propose a solution to the fake news detection problem using <br>the machine learning ensemble approach.
